### ⚙️ Use Case: UC7 – Addition with Target Unit Specification

- Accepts two numerical values with their respective units and a target unit.
- Adds them and returns the sum in the `explicitly specified target unit`.

### ⚙️ Key Implementation Points (UC7 – Explicit Target Unit Addition)

* Refactored `IMeasurable` to add `default methods` for optional arithmetic support.
* Added **SupportsArithmetic** functional interface with lambda-based capability flags.
* Non-temperature units inherit default arithmetic support (**backwards compatible**).
* Temperature explicitly **disables arithmetic** (add, subtract, divide) via overrides.
* `Quantity` validates `operation support upfront` before performing arithmetic.
* Equality and conversion work uniformly via **base-unit normalisation**.
* Cross-category comparisons remain `prohibited and type-safe`.
